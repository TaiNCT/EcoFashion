With the strong development of sustainable fashion trends, utilizing recycled materials for fashion design is becoming a practical solution. However, there is currently a lack of platforms that effectively support designers in showcasing, sharing, and selling products made from recycled materials. Challenges include:
- Limited access to and processing of quality recycled materials
- Lack of online platforms to showcase and promote recycled fashion products
- Need to create differentiation between recycled fashion and conventional fashion
- Support for connecting designers, recycled material suppliers, and potential customers
